# Music-Maker
It is a python program which focuses on generating music using GAN. The model is trained on Theme music data of various movies to generate a new music.


Generative Music Project with GAN:
Spearheaded a groundbreaking project centered on generative music creation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Studied theme music from a diverse range of movies to train the GAN, employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to capture intricate musical patterns. The result is an innovative system capable of autonomously generating captivating and original tunes inspired by the rich themes of various films.

Theme-Inspired Melody Synthesis:
Implemented a sophisticated music synthesis system that harnesses the power of GANs, leveraging LSTM as an RNN to learn and replicate the nuanced patterns present in theme music from diverse movie genres. The project goes beyond traditional music generation by creating tunes that are not only technically sound but also carry the emotional essence of the original themes, offering a unique and immersive musical experience.

Innovative Fusion of AI and Music Theory:
Pioneered the fusion of artificial intelligence and music theory, employing GANs and LSTM to analyze and synthesize theme music from various movies. This novel approach not only showcases technical proficiency but also highlights a deep understanding of musical intricacies. The resulting system stands as a testament to the intersection of AI and artistic expression, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in the realm of generative music.
